<p>Collection of Information</p>
<p>The information collected by BigFanMail.com falls into two categories: (1) information voluntarily supplied by visitors to and users of the website and (2) tracking information recorded as visitors and users navigate through the website.  Some of this information is personally identifiable information, but much of it is not. Personally identifiable information is information that identifies a particular person.</p> 
<p>As a general policy, BigFanMail.com does not automatically collect “personal” information from visitors to this website.  However, certain non-personal information of visitors is recorded by the standard operation of the BigFanMail.com Service.  We use so-called “cookies,” which are small files stored on a computer's hard drive to simplify and improve a user’s Web experience.  The cookie does not personally identify you.  Our website may store information in a cookie about your computer configuration so that it can more efficiently provide information to you the next time you visit the site.  Or, your browser program might save a cookie with your username and password so that a website's server will automatically recognize you the next time you access the site.</p> 
<p>Generally, information tracked by our system includes the type of browser being used by the visitor, the type of operating system in use by the visitor and the domain name of the visitor's Internet service provider.  By having this information, Web pages optimized for a particular visitor's computer are automatically made available to that visitor.  We may also use aggregate, non-personally identifiable information to determine the number of visitors to this website and to determine which products and services are the most popular with our website visitors.</p> 
<p>We may also use one or more advertising network providers to help present advertisements or other content on this website.  These advertising network providers use cookies, web beacons, or other technologies to serve you advertisements or content tailored to interests you have shown by browsing on this and other websites you have visited.  Advertising network providers collect non-personally identifiable information such as your browser type, your operating system, web pages visited, time of visits, content viewed, ads viewed, and other click stream data.</p> 
<p>In addition to the information that is collected by our system, you may also voluntarily provide to BigFanMail.com when you visit certain areas of this website personal information about yourself, such as your name, address, email address, and other information that may personally identify you.  Although this information is not generally required by BigFanMail.com for you to use this website, BigFanMail.com may be unable to provide you with some products and services that we make available to other visitors to our website without the information.  You also will not be able to order selected products or services over the BigFanMail.com website unless you provide certain personally identifying information about yourself.  The information you supply will help us to offer you more personalized features, to tailor our website to your interests and make it more useful to you.  Our system will remember some of this information the next time you login to our secure eCommerce section and use our website, but can be changed later by you.</p> 
<p>BigFanMail.com is especially concerned with children who access and use this website.  BigFanMail.com does not knowingly collect personally identifiable information from children under the age of thirteen.  If BigFanMail.com (or any other website operator) collects personal information from children under the age of thirteen, we must first obtain parental consent.  Children should always get permission from their parents before sending any information about themselves over the Internet.  BigFanMail.com strongly encourages parents to supervise their children’s online activities and consider using parental control tools available from online services and software manufacturers that help control access to certain content on the Internet.  These tools can also help prevent children from disclosing online personal information without parental permission.</p>
